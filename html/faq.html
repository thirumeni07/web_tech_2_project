        <h3>What additional charges can be added to my base fare?</h3>
        <p>
                Like all other airlines, we’re required to collect taxes, fees and charges for a variety of purposes, including
                national security, infrastructure enhancement and airport maintenance. Other foreign taxes, fees and charges are
                collected on behalf of foreign governments. Airlines also collect surcharges in an effort to partially offset the
                volatility of and fluctuations in operating costs, such as the costs associated with the use of Canada's and other
                foreign countries' air navigational infrastructure and services, and the costs associated with the price of fuel.

                The amount you pay in taxes, fees, charges and surcharges on a ticket is based on your itinerary (e.g. the number
                of times you board a new flight and at what airport).
                
                For example, on a typical ticket for an international itinerary, you can expect to pay:
                
                Canadian and provincial sales taxes
                Foreign taxes, fees and charges
                An airport improvement fee (levied by various airports across the country to fund airport improvements),
                A federal air travellers’ security charge to fund security personnel and security equipment
                Navigational, fuel or other surcharges
                We’re committed to being as transparent as possible about which taxes, fees, charges and surcharges are collected
                with your purchase. For this reason:
                
                Our Special Offers and Select Flight pages display the base fare amount in addition to the approximate taxes, fees, 
                charges and surcharges associated with a given itinerary, as well as the total price associated with the itinerary.
                You can see the total price you’ll have to pay and the breakdown of the amounts of applicable taxes and fees as well
                as other charges and surcharges for your itinerary:prior to purchase, on the Review Booking page (just click on the 
                ‘See details’ link) after purchase, on your itinerary-receipt
                Your travel agent should also be able to explain taxes, fees, charges and surcharges to you.
                 
                
                Find out more about the taxes, fees, charges and surcharges that may be added to your ticket at time of purchase.</p>
        
        <h3>What happens if I buy a ticket and an emergency disrupts my travel?</h3>
        <p>
                Air Canada will cancel any purchased ticket and provide a full refund without penalty up to 24 hours after purchase.

                Beyond 24 hours of purchase, a non-refundable ticket offers no options in the event that an unexpected medical emergency
                or other unforeseen circumstance forces you to cancel your trip or modify your travel plans. And we can’t make any 
                exception to the fare rules.
                
                The best advice is to prepare and plan for the unexpected. Many travellers consider the purchase of cancellation insurance
                as a good investment against such risks. Some payment cards also cover trip cancellations; check with your bank or service 
                provider.The time to make these decisions is when you purchase your ticket.</p>
        
        <h3>Are check-in times really important?</h3>
        <p>
                Yes, they’re critical to the on-time departure and, more importantly, the on-time arrival of your flight.

                Online check-in is simply the best way to check in for your flight, and You can check in and print your
                boarding pass as early as 24 hours before your flight.
                
                You can also check in at one of our airport kiosks up to 12 hours in advance, and print your own baggage
                tags at airports across Canada, in the U.S. and at London Heathrow.
                
                Learn more about Check-in and boarding times.
                
                Behind the facts:
                Customers sometimes question the need to arrive so early for check-in and boarding. The fact is there's a
                lot that goes into making sure a flight leaves on time. For our part, we need to have an aircraft and crew 
                ready to leave at the scheduled departure time. When you respect the check-in times, you're giving us a 
                tremendous advantage in terms of getting every checked bag on the plane and issuing all the boarding passes
                - without a last minute rush. That's something we really appreciate.
                
                Early check-in also gives you the time you need to pass through the various security screening points en route
                to your gate. These security processes and procedures are a fact of life in today's airports and they often
                take time. In the case of flights to the United States, you may also need to go through U.S. immigration and
                 customs formalities before boarding.
        </p>
        <h3>What happens if there's a long delay – the kind where I could be on a plane for hours or wind up
             sleeping at the airport?</h3>
        <p>
                Just the facts:
                In the case of delays caused by Air Canada, which are expected to last longer than 2 hours, we’ll offer a voucher 
                for use at an airport restaurant or for our Air Canada Bistro service. We’ll also communicate with you at regular 
                intervals to provide an update on the flight status with the latest, most accurate information available. In the 
                case of an unplanned overnight stay caused by Air Canada, we’ll provide out-of-town customers with meal vouchers,
                transportation to and from the airport as well as hotel accommodations (subject to availability).
                
                Behind the facts:
                Without a doubt, long delays are one of the worst airline experiences, and we do everything we can to avoid them.
                But, they do happen.
                
                We can't control the weather, power outages, acts of God, riots, traffic congestion, airport construction or 
                security-related situations. In these cases, we won't provide compensation, but we’ll do our best to get you 
                on your way as quickly as possible.
                
                But when it's our fault, we'll take full responsibility for the situation. If the delay continues for a matter of
                hours, we’ll do our best to see that you get something to eat and drink. We’ll look after out-of-town customers who
                are trapped at the airport overnight and find them hotel accommodations (subject to availability).
        </p>
        
        <h3>Does you overbook its flights?</h3>
        <p>
                Just the facts:
                Yes, we do.
                
                Behind the facts:
                Airline passengers place a high value on refundable tickets (in case they can't make their flight, don't show up or 
                decide to change travel plans). In these cases, overbooking is a means (certainly not perfect but, on the whole, pretty 
                viable) that lets us offer refundable tickets without losing a lot of money.
                
                In the rare circumstances (and it is rare) where you can't get on a flight due to overbooking, we offer compensation 
                (in the form of a travel voucher or cash) and we make alternate arrangements to get you to your destination as quickly 
                as possible.
        </p>
        <h3>I know that my air travel has an impact on the environment. What can I - and Air Canada - do about it?</h3>
        <p>
               We all know that carbon dioxide (CO2) has an impact on climate change. You can make a difference by offsetting the CO2 
               emissions generated through your flight. We have partnered with Less Emissions to provide the highest quality carbon 
               offsets to reduce the environmental impact of your flights. You can choose to purchase offsets to mitigate the CO2 
               emissions associated with your travel while supporting carbon reduction programs in developing countries and here in 
               Canada. 

               For our part, we’re working on a number of fronts to be a better environmental citizen. We’ve adopted more fuel-efficient
               procedures for take-offs and landings, reduced engine usage on the ground during taxiing and ground delays, cut fuel 
               consumption in the air with more efficient aircraft and flight plans, expanded our on-board recycling program and employed 
               hybrid technology for airport vehicles. Learn more about what we're doing.
        </p>
        <h3>What happens if my flight is delayed?</h3>
        <p>
            Just the facts:
            Our prime objective is to let you know as early as possible if there's a schedule change or delay, so please make sure to
            provide us with accurate contact information at time of booking. We can't contact you if we don't have the right telephone or
            email information.

            The best way to stay on top of the latest arrival and departure information for your flight is to sign up to receive an 
            automatic email or SMS text message on your cell phone with one of our Flight Notification services. Real-time flight 
            information is also available on our Flight Status page, or by calling our automated flight information system at
            1-888-422-7533.

            Passengers hate to arrive at the airport only to find that their flight has been delayed, and we hate to have to tell them.
            But, if you've already arrived at the airport, we'll do our best to let you know what's going on at regular intervals and keep
            you updated about the status of your flight. In the case of last-minute cancellations, we'll help you rebook on the next Air Canada flight with available seats, or cancel the ticket and refund you if you prefer.
